For this reason, your doctor will try to rule out other possible causes of your problem.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTo help diagnose giant cell arteritis, you may have some or all of the following tests and procedures:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPhysical exam. In addition to asking about your symptoms and medical history, your doctor is likely to perform a thorough physical exam, paying particular attention to your temporal arteries. Often, one or both of these arteries are tender with a reduced pulse and a hard, cord-like feel and appearance.\n\t\t\t\t\tBlood tests. If your doctor thinks you might have giant cell arteritis, you're likely to have a blood test that checks your erythrocyte sedimentation rate - commonly referred to as the sed rate. This test measures how quickly red blood cells fall to the bottom of a tube of blood. Red cells that\n\t\t\t\t\tdrop rapidly may indicate inflammation in your body.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou may also have a test that measures C-reactive protein (CRP), a substance your liver produces when inflammation is present. The same tests may be used to follow your progress during treatment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBiopsy. The best way to confirm a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is by taking a small sample (biopsy) of the temporal artery. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis during local anesthesia, usually with little discomfort or scarring. The sample is examined under a microscope in a\n\t\t\t\t\tlaboratory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you have giant cell arteritis, the artery will often show inflammation that includes abnormally large cells, called giant cells, which give the disease its name. It's possible to have giant cell arteritis and still have a negative biopsy result. If the results aren't clear, your doctor may\n\t\t\t\t\tadvise another temporal artery biopsy on the other side of your head.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tImaging tests may be used for diagnosing giant cell arteritis and for monitoring your response to treatment. Possible tests include:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This test combines the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of a contrast material that produces detailed images of your blood vessels. Let your doctor know ahead of time if you're uncomfortable being confined in a small space because the test is\n\t\t\t\t\tconducted in a tube-shaped machine.\n\t\t\t\t\tDoppler ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to produce images of blood flowing through your blood vessels.\n\t\t\t\t\tPositron emission tomography (PET). Using an intravenous tracer solution that contains a tiny amount of radioactive material, a PET scan can produce detailed images of your blood vessels and highlight areas of inflammation."", 'answer_url': 'http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/giant-cell-arteritis/basics/tests-diagnosis/con-20023109', 'comment': ''}, {'aid': 'TQ14A2', 'answer': 'GCA treatment usually involves high doses of corticosteroids.

The speed at which your doctor lowers the dose may change if you have recurring symptoms of GCA or large increases in the sedimentation rate. In most cases, though, the prednisone dose can be\n\t\t\t\t\treduced to about 5 - 10 mg per day over a few months. Patients are usually tapered off this medicine by one to two years.

While all cause liver disease, they vary in important ways.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHepatitis A virus (HAV) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Infections are in many cases mild, with most people making a full recovery and remaining immune from further\n\t\t\t\t\tHAV infections. However, HAV infections can also be severe and life threatening. Most people in areas of the world with poor sanitation have been infected with this virus. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated\n\t\t\t\t\tblood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible, but is\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch less common. There is no vaccine for HCV.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food.

Sometimes, these changes are permanent.', 'answer_url': 'https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000876.htm', 'comment': ''}, {'aid': 'TQ56A2', 'answer': ""Itchy Crotch Cause: Fungal Infections\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: You'll likely develop a rash along with the itching, though its appearance varies depending on the type of fungus causing it. For instance, if a yeast infection is responsible, you may notice moist, shiny areas of skin on your penis, and possibly some white stuff in the\n\t\t\t\t\tskin folds, along with the red, itchy rash, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYeast is normally present in small amounts on your skin, but an overgrowth of it can cause an infection. This tends to occur in moist places that don't get much light, says Jason Reichenberg, M.D., director of dermatology at the University of Texas Austin. So it usually shows up on the sides of your\n\t\t\t\t\tgroin, between your genitals and thighs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOther fungal infections look a little different: They appear dry and flaky, and usually crop up on your thighs, Dr. Reichenberg says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Whatever the type of fungus responsible for your itching, an antifungal cream like Lotrimin AF should do the trick. The cream attacks the fungal cells that cause the infection, while leaving your healthy skin cells unscathed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPat the region dry before rubbing on the cream. That will help get rid moisture, keeping the fungus from growing and allowing the cream to work better, Dr. Reichenberg says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Chafing\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: Chafing occurs when your skin rubs together-commonly your thighs. It usually develops when you're doing an activity that involves a lot of friction, like running.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe rubbing can disturb your skin barrier, causing tiny cracks and inflammation on your outer layers of skin. This causes a red, irritated rash that burns and itches. Your skin can also grow scaly, too, Dr. Zeichner says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Your goal is to protect your irritated skin and prevent any additional rubbing. A moisturizer like Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream will help repair the skin. It also contains colloidal oatmeal, which works to soothe irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPair that with a zinc cream, like Destin, which protects your skin from future rubbing by adding a protective barrier. And then use a cream that contains petroleum, like CeraVe Healing Ointment, which helps hydrate and restore your skin.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Intertrigo\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: You'll develop a raw, red rash that itches and stings, usually in areas that contain lots of moisture from sweating, Dr. Zeichner says-so, like your groin, between the folds of your stomach, under your arms, or between your toes, according to the Mayo Clinic. That\n\t\t\t\t\tmoisture can spur an overgrowth of bacteria and fungus.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Antibacterial creams like Neosporin and antifungal creams, like Lotrimin, can take care of the bacteria and fungus. And a zinc cream, like Destin, shields your skin from more rubbing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the rash persists for one to two weeks, head to your dermatologist. He or she will likely prescribe stronger versions of these medications to smooth over the irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Contact Dermatitis\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: Contact dermatitis occurs when your skin comes in contact with something it's allergic to. You'll likely develop a super itchy, red rash that looks bumpy. It might even ooze a clear or yellowish fluid, which shows that the top layer of your skin has been disrupted, says\n\t\t\t\t\tDr. Reichenberg.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tContact dermatitis is likely the cause if you notice that itchy rash and you've recently changed something in your routine-say, you tried a new laundry detergent or fabric softener, or even bought a new couch made of a different material-right before you noticed it, says Dr. Reichenberg. You'll\n\t\t\t\t\tusually start to notice a reaction hours or even a few days later.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou'll also probably experience itching on other body parts that were exposed to the allergen, too, he says. Your itchy balls will likely bother you more, though, since their thin skin is more sensitive to allergens.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Stop using the chemical or material you think may be responsible. If it's clothing washed in a new detergent, rewash it a few times with your previous brand, says Dr. Reichenberg.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf contact dermatitis was responsible, the reaction should disappear in about two weeks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Pubic lice\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: If you start to notice intense itching, irritation, and tiny specks in your pubic hair, you might have contracted a type of parasite called pubic lice, also known as crabs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou may see tiny white or yellowish specks near the roots of your pubic hair. Those are the lice eggs, says Dennis Fortenberry, M.D., a professor of adolescent medicine at Indiana University. You might also spot the lice themselves crawling-they're tan or grayish-white, and if you're brave enough\n\t\t\t\t\tto look at one through a magnifying glass, it'd resemble a mini crab, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Head to your doctor-he or she will confirm that your problem actually is lice, and send you home with a shampoo or lotion containing either permethrin or pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide, which will kill the lice Dr. Fortenberry says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Herpes\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: For some guys, itching can be the first symptom of this sexually transmitted infection (STI), which is caused by the herpes virus, Dr. Fortenberry says. That itch will usually turn to burning, and within about a day, a blister or cluster of blisters can form. Then, the\n\t\t\t\t\tblisters can break, leading to painful sores.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you've experienced those symptoms in the past and they keep cropping back up, that might point to herpes, since the infection usually causes recurrent outbreaks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: This is another case where you'll head to your doctor. He or she will diagnose you, either by simply looking at the appearance of your blisters or by performing a blood test or culture of the lesion, reports the CDC.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThere's no cure for herpes, but your doctor can provide some treatment. Antiviral meds, like Valtrex, Zovirax, or Famvir, can shorten the outbreak or prevent one from occurring. They also may reduce the chances of passing on the virus to your partner.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Genital Warts\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: Genital warts are a common symptom of the STI human papillomavirus (HPV). They are typically soft to the touch and skin colored, and some may even resemble a cauliflower. You might notice just one, or they could crop up in a cluster, Dr. Fortenberry says. But other than\n\t\t\t\t\tsome itching, the warts don't feel like anything.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: If you think you have genital warts, check in with your doctor, Dr. Fortenberry says. He or she will likely prescribe a medication that contains Imiquimod, Podofilox, or Sinecatechins, which will stimulate your body's immune system to clear up the warts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOr, she may apply liquid nitrogen to the growth, which will freeze it off.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, even though you can get rid of the wart, you can't eliminate the virus from your system-meaning more warts could crop up down the road, and you can still spread it to others if you don't have a visible wart.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis article originally appeared on MensHealth.com."", 'answer_url': 'http://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/02/01/7-reasons-your-groin-is-so-itchy.html', 'comment': ''}]"

The long-term outlook (prognosis) and life expectancy for people with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) varies. The prognosis largely depends on whether there is severe autoimmune disease; whether there are recurrent infections that cause structural lung damage; and the development of a\n\t\t\t\t\tmalignancy (cancer). Other major factors that influence prognosis include the extent of organ damage and how successfully infections can be prevented.\n\t\t\t\t\tAffected people who have only bacterial infections have a better prognosis than those with additional complications and can have nearly normal life expectancy. This is especially the case if they are diagnosed early and begin treatment soon after the onset of symptoms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2. In some cases, abnormal growth of small nodules of lymphoid tissue in the gastrointestinal tract (nodular lymphoid hyperplasia) may occur. In addition, an increased percent of individuals with CVID are more prone to developing certain forms of cancer than the general population such as\n\t\t\t\t\tmalignancies of lymphatic tissue (lymphoma) and possibly stomach cancer). The risk of gastric carcinoma is almost 50 times greater in patients with CVID than in other individuals.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn addition, some individuals with CVID may develop granular, inflammatory nodules (noncaseating granulomas) within tissue of the skin, lungs, spleen, and/or liver.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3.

Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia\n\t\t\t\t\tassociated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and\n\t\t\t\t\tsperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome\n\t\t\t\t\tarchitecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous\n\t\t\t\t\trecombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.', 'answer_url': '1. http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v13/n9/full/5201442a.html\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2. https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/7q1123-duplication-syndrome#inheritance\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3. https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/dna-deletion-and-duplication-and-the-associated-331', 'comment': ''}]"

The defining characteristics of syncope include rapid onset with transient loss of consciousness usually accompanied by falling, followed by spontaneous, complete, and usually prompt recovery without intervention. Because some patients use the term dizziness to describe syncopal\n\t\t\t\t\tevents, it is important to ask patients exactly what they mean by dizziness and whether loss of consciousness occurred.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSyncope must be differentiated from vertigo, coma, drop attacks, dizziness, sudden cardiac death, and seizures. Vertigo (i.e., sensation of movement) does not include loss of consciousness. Coma involves loss of consciousness without spontaneous recovery. Drop attacks involve sudden falls without loss\n\t\t\t\t\tof consciousness or warning and with immediate recovery. Drop attacks may be idiopathic but also have several specific causes (e.g., underlying cardiovascular disease, spondylotic osteophytes or colloidal cysts that transiently block the vertebral arteries or cerebral aqueduct, vertebrobasilar\n\t\t\t\t\tstroke).
