      "Answer: Congenital night blindness, also known as congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), is typically identified in childhood, often when a child has difficulty seeing in low light or dark environments. The condition is characterized by several symptoms, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Difficulty Seeing in Low Light**: The primary symptom is trouble seeing in dimly lit conditions, which may be noticed by parents or caregivers when the child struggles in dark rooms or during nighttime.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Visual Acuity Issues**: Individuals with CSNB may have reduced visual acuity, which can range from 20/30 to 20/200. This can be assessed through a standard eye examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Other Vision Problems**: Additional symptoms may include myopia (nearsightedness), nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), strabismus (crossed eyes), and normal color vision. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Family History**: Since CSNB is often inherited, a family history of similar vision problems can be a clue.\n",
      "\n",
      "To confirm a diagnosis, a comprehensive ophthalmic examination is necessary, which may include:\n",
      "- **Electroretinogram (ERG)**: This test measures the electrical responses of the retina's light-sensitive cells and can help differentiate CSNB from other retinal disorders.\n",
      "- **Dilated Fundus Examination**: This allows the eye doctor to examine the retina for any abnormalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you suspect congenital night blindness, it is important to consult an eye care specialist for a thorough evaluation and diagnosis.\n",

A molar pregnancy occurs when there is a problem during the fertilization process, leading to the development of abnormal tissue instead of a normal embryo and placenta. This genetic error can happen at the time of conception when the sperm fertilizes the egg, resulting in either a complete or partial molar pregnancy. In a complete molar pregnancy, the fertilized egg lacks maternal genetic material, while in a partial molar pregnancy, there may be some fetal tissue, but it is always abnormal and cannot survive.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Consult a Healthcare Professional**: It's crucial to consult with a doctor or a gastroenterologist who can evaluate his symptoms and provide a tailored treatment plan. Unexplained weight loss and fainting can indicate more serious issues that need medical attention.\n",

      "2. **Dietary Adjustments**: A low-FODMAP diet may help manage IBS symptoms. This diet involves reducing fermentable carbohydrates that can trigger symptoms. Foods that are generally well-tolerated include bananas, blueberries, oranges, and certain vegetables. However, it's best to work with a nutritionist to ensure he is getting adequate nutrition while following this diet.\n",

      "6. **Manage Stress**: Stress can exacerbate IBS symptoms. Consider relaxation techniques such as yoga, meditation, or gentle exercise, which may help improve his overall well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Consider Supplements**: If he is unable to get enough nutrients from food, discuss with his doctor the possibility of nutritional supplements to help maintain his weight and energy levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Medication**: Depending on the severity of his symptoms, medications may be prescribed to help manage IBS and its effects on his weight.\n",
